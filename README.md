# Police Shootings in the US - Data Analysis Project

**Project Overview**

Since January 1, 2015, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) has been diligently collecting data on fatal shootings by police officers in the United States that occurred while the officers were on duty. This data analysis project focuses on examining and understanding this comprehensive database, shedding light on the important issue of police shootings in the country.

**Data Collection and Sources**

The Washington Post's database of police shootings is the result of extensive data collection efforts and collaboration with various sources. The following are key aspects of data collection and sources:

- **Start Date:** The data collection effort began on January 1, 2015, providing a substantial timeframe for analysis.

- **Details Collected:** The database includes a wide range of details for each incident, helping to provide a comprehensive view of each case. These details include the race, age, and gender of the deceased individual, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis.

- **Data Sources:** The Washington Post gathers information from diverse sources, including law enforcement websites, local news reports, and social media. They also monitor independent databases such as "Killed by police" and "Fatal Encounters" to ensure comprehensive coverage.

- **Additional Reporting:** In many cases, The Washington Post conducts additional reporting to supplement the available information, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data.

**Project Goals**

The primary goals of this data analysis project are as follows:

1. **Understanding Police Shootings:** Analyzing the data to gain insights into the patterns and trends of police shootings in the US. This includes examining factors such as race, age, and cities.

2. **Identifying Disparities:** Exploring potential disparities in police shootings, particularly in terms of race, to raise awareness about this critical issue.


**Tools and Techniques**

This project will utilize various tools and techniques for data analysis, including:

- Python for data manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
- Data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn to create informative plots and charts.
- Jupyter Notebook for code development and documentation.



## Conclusion
- **Poverty Rate and Graduation Rate Relationship**: An inverse relationship between the Poverty Rate and High School Graduation Rate is evident in the data. Specifically, areas with lower poverty rates tend to have higher rates of high school graduation. This relationship is vividly illustrated through data visualizations within the project.
- **Gender Disparities in Police-Related Deaths**: The analysis highlights a significant gender disparity in police-related fatalities. Males are disproportionately affected, comprising a larger portion of the victims compared to females. Additionally, the analysis reveals that male victims tend to be of older ages. The box plot analysis underscores that both male and female victims share a common median age at which they are most vulnerable to such incidents.
- **Armed vs. Unarmed Victims**: The data analysis reveals a noteworthy finding—approximately 93.23% of individuals fatally shot by the police were armed. This statistic suggests that a substantial proportion of these incidents may have occurred in situations where law enforcement officers perceived a threat to public safety or the safety of those around individuals carrying weapons.
- **Age Distribution of Victims**:  Examining the age distribution of victims, the analysis identifies a peak in the number of fatalities occurring between the ages of 20 and 40 years. This age group appears to be particularly vulnerable to police-related fatalities.
- **Mental Health and Police-Related Fatalities**: The analysis uncovers that approximately 24.97% of individuals killed by the police were reported to be experiencing mental health issues. This finding underscores the importance of addressing mental health crises effectively in encounters with law enforcement.
- **City-Specific Fatalities**: The project presents informative charts that depict cities and states with the highest numbers of police-related fatalities. Furthermore, these charts break down the data by race. Notably, the data reveals that the order of fatalities by race, from highest to lowest, is White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American.
- **Trends in Police-Related Fatalities**: The analysis of the data points to a significant trend—there has been a decline in the number of police-related fatalities since the latter half of 2017. This observation suggests that government and law enforcement agencies may have implemented effective measures to address and mitigate this pressing issue.
